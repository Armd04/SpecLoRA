# Speculative Decoding with Adaptive LoRA Configuration
# Optimized for 16GB RAM MacBook

# Model Configuration
models:
  # Target model (larger, quantized)
  target:
    name: "mlx-community/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-4bit"  # 7B model - needs more RAM
    # name: "mlx-community/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct-4bit"  # 3B model - better for 16GB RAM
    
  # Draft model (smaller, trainable)
  draft:
    name: "mlx-community/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-4bit"  # Quantized for lower memory
    # name: "mlx-community/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-bf16"  # BF16 alternative
    # name: "mlx-community/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-4bit"  # Larger draft model
