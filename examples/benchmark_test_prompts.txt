Implement a basic stack using a Python list with push, pop, and peek methods.

Write a function to reverse a linked list iteratively in Python.

Implement binary search on a sorted array. Return the index or -1 if not found.

# Algorithms - Core concepts
Write a function to check if a string has all unique characters without using extra data structures.

Implement BFS traversal for a graph represented as an adjacency list.

Write a function to find the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm.

# ML/AI - Conceptual understanding
Explain the difference between L1 and L2 regularization and when to use each.

What is the softmax function and why is it used in classification tasks? Show the formula.

Explain why we use mini-batch gradient descent instead of full batch or pure stochastic.

# Complexity & Theory
What is the time complexity of inserting into a balanced BST? Explain why.

Compare the space complexity of BFS vs DFS for tree traversal.

# Systems Programming - Short examples
